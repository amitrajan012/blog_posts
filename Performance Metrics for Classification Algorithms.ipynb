    "\n",
    "<b>Confusion matrix</b> is one of the easiest and the most intutive way to find the correctness and accuracy of the model. It serves as the building block for all the other performance measures. A sample confusion matrix is shown below: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/cm.PNG\"  width=\"400px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>True Positive (TP)</b> is the cell which has both the actual and predicted classes as <b>True</b>. <b>False Positive (FP)</b> is the cell for which the actual class label is <b>False</b> but the predicted class label is <b>True</b>. <b>True Negative (TN)</b> is the cell for which both the actual and predicted class labels are <b>False</b>. <b>False Negative (FN)</b> is the cell for which the actual class label is <b>True</b> but the predicted class label is <b>False</b>. In the above confusion matrix, <b>TP = 100, FP = 10, TN = 50, FN = 5</b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "All these quantities have different and important effects when it comes to the problem statement. For example, in the case of a model which detects the cancerous cell, we need to minimize the False Negative as miss classifying a cancerous tumor as non-cancerous will have a significant impact. In the case of the model which identifies spam emails, we need to minimize False Positive rate, as they will lead to the classification of important emails as spams."

    "<b>AUC(Area under the Curve)-ROC(Receiver Operating Characteristics) Curve</b> is one of the most important measure of the classification performance. ROC curve is plotted as <b>true positive rate (TPR)</b> against <b>false positive rate (FPR)</b>. TPR is the classification accuracy rate for the true positive observations, which can be given as $\\frac{TP}{TP+FN} = Recall$. FPR is the false positive rate and tells us about the fraction of true negative observations which are falsely classified as positive and is given as $\\frac{FP}{FP+TN} = 1 - Specificity$. An ideal or favorable ROC curve should be hugging the top left corner and should have an area closed to 1 under it. The ROC curve with an area of 0.5 tells that the classifier has no classification power as such."
